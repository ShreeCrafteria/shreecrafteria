                Lippan art is a traditional form of decorative wall mural found
                in the Kutch region of Gujarat, India. It involves creating
                intricate patterns using a mixture of mud and camel dung,
                adorned with mirrors and colorful embellishments. It's not only
                visually striking but also serves cultural and spiritual
                significance in the local communities.
